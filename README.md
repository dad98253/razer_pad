# razer_pad
A fun little program that changes the Razer Goliathus Extended Chroma Gaming Mouse Pad color based on CPU utilization

Compiled using gcc on ubuntu 18.04

It requires the OpenRazer driver
(see https://openrazer.github.io/ )

To run the program in the background:

sudo pad &

If you are running polychormatic or some other razer control software, you may need to kill it 
before starting this program...
