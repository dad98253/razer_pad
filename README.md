# razer_pad
A fun little program that changes the Razer Pad color based on CPU utilization

Compiled using gcc on ubuntu 18.04

To run the program in the background:

sudo pad &

If you are running polychormatic or some other razer control software, you may need to kill it 
before starting this program...
